# Binary and Multi-Class Classification AI Project
This project aims to implement an application capable of solving both binary and multi-class classification problems using machine learning techniques. Classification problems involve categorizing data points into two or more classes, and our application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for dynamic data input, parameter tuning, and performance visualization.

Features:
- Have a GUI to allow the user to enter the data points dynamically
- Allow the user to enter the learning rate and maximum number of iterations
- Display the system performance
- Include a graphical representation of the classification regions after training
